Hello!

My name is Tucker Mackie and I am currently attending Appalachian State University. I graduate this December with a Bachelors degree of Arts and Science with a concentration in Statistics. As I have studied my degree I have picked up many skills in coding and programming. I have become highly proficient in R, proficient in Python, proficient in SQL, highly proficient in Excel. Using these programs I have been able to learn many skills and complete many tests.
